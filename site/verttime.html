                    <p> Google is founded by Larry Page and Sergey Bryn. 
                    Google in it itself is a corporation, but also a website. 
                    The website offers services such as apps, satellite maps and email 
                    accounts, but Google is mostly known for its search-engine, which was 
                    the original concept in 1998. With this search-engine you can search 
                    the web for anything; videos, documents, websites and pictures. Google 
                    is the most visited website in the world, and also the source of the web-browser; Google Chrome.

                <h2>Wikipedia</h2>
                    <p> Wikipedia is launched by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger. 
                    Wikipedia is one of the most popular websites in the world, and 
                    perhaps the most educational one. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia on 
                    the internet, with information on everything. It has more than 4.5 
                    billion articles in English, and more than 18 billion page views. The 
                    only problem is that anyone can edit it, so there is always a small 
                    chance that what you’re reading is wrong.
