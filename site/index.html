                         to be alert at all times.

                        weapons. The technology revolutionizes data communications.</p>

                    <p>Lawrence Roberts (MIT) and Thomas Marill got an ARPA

                        Massachusetts and a Q-32 in California. The system

                    <p>ARPA started developing the idea of an inter-networked set

                        which they considered included Baran and the RAND Corporation's
                        "On Distrubuted Communications" volumes.
                        The resiliency of a packet-switched network that uses link-state
                        routing protocols used on the Internet stems in some part from the
                        research to develop a network that could survive a nuclear attack.
                        ARPAnet was one of the
                            most significant predecessors to the WWW.

                        It was simply called WorldWideWeb
                        at first, but later dubbed Nexus. At the time, it was only a way of navigating
                        websites, and nothing like the browsers we use today. However, it was the
                        groundwork for internet browsing and one of the main reasons Tim Berners-Lee was knighted. </p>

                        the web for anything; videos, documents, websites and pictures. Google
                        is the most visited website in the world and also the source of the web-browser; Google Chrome.

                        for example, they bought "Hitchiker", and made it into their own, Microsoft Mobile Explorer. This
                        browser could handle both HTML and WAP, and it was available on several of Sony's phones. So, even if it
                        wasn't used that much, it was a breakthrough.

                    <h2>Tor Is Released</h2>
                    <p>Tor (The Onion Router) is released in 2002. It is a software that keeps the identity
                        and the location of their clients hidden from all surveillance and encrypts everything
                        the user does, and because of that, it is also very slow. All of this is achieved through
                        Tor’s own browser, Tor, which can also be used to access hidden information on the web, like
                        the darknet.

                    <p>In 2002 3G was first launched in various European countries (It was launched in Japan in 2001).
                        3G is the "third generation of mobile telecommunications technology", and the 3G networks provide
                        information on a transfer rate of at least 200 kbit/s, which is a lot faster than 1G and 2G.
                        While the use of it was very limited at the time, this would eventually become the big thing in 2007.

                        The ACID2 test was designed to find flaws in the browser design, and so, this meant that Opera and Opera

                        uploaded every hour. Needless to say, it is the

                        140 characters long, so you don't have to worry about spamming.
                        It’s an easy way to find out what your friends are up to, and much simpler to use than Facebook.
                        As of July 2014, Twitter has more than 500 million users.

                        Safari became iPhone's default browser, and it just
                        became better and better, going from the use of 2G and 3G, to the use of 3G and 4G (like we use today).
                        The iPhone allows for easy navigation with it`s touchscreen, although zooming might be required in
                        some cases. The biggest problem is probably that it doesn't support Javascript, which limits the browsing.

                    <p>Currently, the biggest competitors in the browser war are Internet Explorer,
                        Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome. Explorer peaked in 2002 and 2003, with about
                        95% of the browser usage share, but it has been declining ever since. Firefox 
                        has about 12-24%, and Chrome has about 45% of
                        the usage share. Safari also deserves a mention, with 3.7%. Keep in mind
                        though, that the user shares of browsers are incredibly difficult to calculate, so all of these numbers are estimates.
