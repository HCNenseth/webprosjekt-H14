                    <h2>The First Web Browser</h2>
                    <p>The first web browser is created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1990
                        (who also invented the World Wide Web). It was simply called WorldWideWeb 
                        at first, but later dubbed Nexus. At the time, it was only a way of navigating 
                        websites, and nothing like the browsers we use today. However, it was the 
                        groundwork for internet browsing, and one of the main reasons Tim Berners-Lee was knighted. </p>

                    <p>The first website ever, CERN’s website, was put online. CERN is a
                        European organization whose task is to operate different particle
                        physics laboratories. With their website, they were able to share
                        information among their researchers. This was a result of Tim Berners-Lee
                        and Robert Cailliau’s work with the project ENQUIRE, which was the predecessor
                        to the World Wide Web.

                        the web for anything; videos, documents, websites and pictures. Google
                        is the most visited website in the world, and also the source of the web-browser; Google Chrome.

                        for example, they bought "Hitchiker", and made it into their own, Microsoft Mobile Explorer. This
                        browser could handle both HTML and WAP, and it was available on several of Sony's phones. So, even if it

                    <h2>Safari Released</h2>
                    <p>Apple’s Safari is released in 2003. Safari turned into the default users for Macbook users, 
                        much like Explorer turned into Microsoft’s. Safari is known to be a fast browser (especially
                        for Mac users), with good security and flexibility.

                    <p>Facebook is founded by Mark Zuckerberg and his roommates, at Harvard University.
                        Facebook is a social network used for communication and
                        sharing between friends and family, which continued to
                        grow exponentially after its founding. Today, it has more
                        than 1.3 billion active users, and has become a global phenomenon.

                    <p>Opera Mini has several limited releases in Europe. Opera excelled at mobile Internet, mainly
                     because of how versatile it was. This lead to it being the first browser to pass the "ACID2" test. 
                     This test was designed to find flaws in the browser design, and so, this meant that Opera and Opera
                      Mini were excellent for mobile browsing.

                    <p>In 1998, Netscape launched the Mozilla Foundation, in response to 
                        Internet Explorer’s huge success. It got many names throughout the 
                        years, including Pheonix and Firebird, but eventually it turned into 
                        Mozilla Firefox, which was properly released in 2004. Firefox is known 
                        for good security, speedy browsing and its browser engine, Gecko. It 
                        quickly became popular, and a competitor to Explorer.

                    <p>Youtube is founded in 2005, and later bought by Google in 2006.
                        Youtube is a website that allows users to view, upload
                        and share videos. The first video that was ever uploaded was

                        video, of a man visiting the zoo. Youtube is visited by more than 1 billion
                        unique users every month, and about 100 hours of video is
                        uploaded to Youtube every hour. Needless to say, it is the
                        biggest site for sharing videos on the internet.

                    <p>Twitter is created and launched. Twitter is another global phenomenon,
                        much like Facebook. On Twitter, users send out small messages called “Tweets”,
                        that people who are following them can see. These tweets are only a maximun of 
                        140 characters long, so you don't have to worry about spamming.
                        It’s an easy way to find out what your friends are up to, and much simpler than Facebook. 
                        As of July 2014, Twitter has 
                        more than 500 million users.

                    <p>The biggest step towards mobile Internet was probably with the release of the iPhone in 2007.
                     Safari quickly became the iPhone's default browser, and with new releases of the iPhone, it just
                     became better and better, going from the use of 2G and 3G, to the use of 3G and 4G (which we use today).
                      The iPhone allows for easy navigating with the touchscreen, although zooming in might be required in
                      some cases. The biggest problem is probably that it doesn't support Javascript, which limits the browsing.

                    <h2>Google Joins The Browser War</h2>
                    <p>Google Chrome was released by (you guessed it), Google, in 2008. 
                        Chrome was created with the Webkit layout engine, and most of its code 
                        is released as an open-source project called Chromium. It struggled 
                        slightly at first, but it quickly became one of the most used browsers.

                    <p>The iPad was launched in 2010. The iPad is a tablet, which means that it is much bigger,
                     and allows for much easier navigating than the iPhone. This was a major breakthrough in mobile
                      browsing, as it made things so much easier. The iPhone uses Safari as a default browser, just like
                       the iPhone, mainly because their publisher is Apple.

                    <h2>The Current Browser War</h2>
                    <p>Currently, the biggest competitors in the browser war are Internet Explorer, 
                        Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome. Explorer peaked in 2002 and 2003, with about 
                        95% of the browser usage share, but it has been declining ever since, sinking to 
                        about 27-44%. Firefox had to work for several years to get up to where the other 
                        browsers are, but today it has a usage share of about 12-24%. Chrome is the most 
                        recent of the big competitors, meaning it's the fastest growing one, with about 45% of 
                        the usage share. Safari also deserves a mention, as it has about 3.7%. Keep in mind 
                        though, that the user shares of browsers are incredibly difficult to calculate, hence the estimates.
